# Summary
I worked at Streetbees to complete a 4 month MSc research project, where I was a permanent member of the team as a Research Machine Learning Scientist. I improved the state-of-the-art Google BERT models on key sentiment analysis metrics, which were essential for Streetbees product use cases. My code was integrated into the internal codebase which powers their tools.
