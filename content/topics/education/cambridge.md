# Summary
I studied at [Girton College](https://girton.cam.ac.uk), [Cambridge](https://cam.ac.uk) from 2015-2018, where I achieved a high 2.i BA Mathematics.

I specialised in statistics, optimisation, information and computability as well as quantum mechanics. These specialisms improved my foundational knowledge for machine learning and AI.

# Notable Achievements
* I held the position of JCR Treasurer, becoming a Girton College trustee, in 2016-2018.

# Courses
## Computational Projects (CATAM)
I completed 8 [computational mathematics](https://github.com/RyanJenkinson/University-Projects) projects in MATLAB during my undergraduate degree. These were:

* Policy Improvement for a Markov Decision Process
* Variable Selection and the Bias-Variance Tradeoff
* Minimisation of Deterministic Finite-state Automata (DFAs)
* Ordinary Differential Equations
* Matrices over Finite Fields
* SchrÃ¶dingers Equation
* Simulation of Random Samples from Parametric Distributions
