* Applied Machine Learning
* Probabilistic and Unsupervised Learning, a PhD module taught by the [UCL Gatsby](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/) unit
* MSc Project

## MSc Project
I completed my [MSc Project](https://www.github.com/RyanJenkinson/MScThesis) in the area of Natural Language Programming (NLP). Specifically I was investigating methods of "aspect-based sentiment analysis", understanding sentiments towards key topics and aspects within a sentence.

My methodology built on top of state-of-the-art deep learning models, specifically Google BERT variants, using the [Huggingface Transformers library](https://www.github.com/huggingface/transformers).

I completed this project during a 4 month internship with a scale-up tech company, [Streetbees](https://www.streetbees.com), where I was a Research Machine Learning Scientist as a part of their research team. This research was integrated into their company codebase and used in production.
