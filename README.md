## Overview
Here is the code for my personal website, [https://ryan.eco](https://ryan.eco).

I previously wrote my website in [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) but decided I wanted to use a framework to create a more minimal codebase that made it easy for me to blog. To do this, I chose [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and the [PaperMod theme](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod).
